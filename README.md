# Winter's Claw

## üìù Description
Welcome to Winter's Claw, a Discord Bot showing you all kinds of personal and global statistics for Riot Games' Teamfight Tactics, utilizing the discord.py library.

- **Motivation** When I first started this Bot as my first bigger project I was just looking for a fun way to engage more into programming, while combining it with something I already loved. 
It started out as just a nice little tool for me and a few friends to keep track of all our statistics inside the Discord 
server we were always in anyways and after Set 9 ended and we stopped playing it also ended as that.

- **Problem solved** Winter's Claw makes all the stats people want to see about their own performance accessible directly in their own Discord Server without the need of opening an additional webpage.

- **Why I picked it back up** When Set 11 released and looked as fun as Tft had ever been, I remembered this project and brought it up-to-date. 
After looking around a bit, I realised that there was no actively running Bot, offering what I originally planned to do with this project, so I decided to add more features and documentation to make it public.

- **What I learned** While building this project I learned a lot about programming and Python in general, while also getting deeper insights into how to use API requests and Coroutines.

- **Future Plans** I plan to add more features to the bot by displaying more detailed personal stats and also offering current meta builds and other global statistics.

## ü§ñ Commands
